Finding the Optimal Irrigation Parameters for a Plant Cultivation Problem Using Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm





In this study, a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm is designed to find the optimal irrigation parameters using the PSO algorithm to maximize plant growth and minimize water consumption in a garden. The algorithm employs the NumPy library to perform various mathematical operations. The code defines various variables such as garden area, soil type, and plant type, and includes functions for the objective function, PSO algorithm, and fitness value calculation.

The PSO algorithm creates a certain number of particles, each with a specific velocity and position. Each particle represents a set of parameters used to calculate the fitness function. The algorithm computes the fitness function values for each particle and keeps track of their best positions and fitness values. Subsequently, the algorithm updates the particles' velocities and positions to move towards better positions. This process continues for a specified number of iterations, eventually yielding the best position and fitness values.
